React-Fetching-Data-with-useEffect

http://localhost:3000/




In that project i fetch data from an API End point, using AXIOS library.

The API end point is: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.

Also in that project i use Functional Components.

If something is going wrong with getting data, the project shows a message.




There three ways that i have made that fetching.

1. With the first way i just fetch all data.
2. With the second way there is a text box element i can write a number and then automatically the project return me that record. There is no button element.
3. With the third way there is a text box and a button element. I write the number of the row and then i have to press the button to fetch me the right row.
